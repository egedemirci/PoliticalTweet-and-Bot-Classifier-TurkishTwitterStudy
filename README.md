### Political Tweet and Bot Classifier - Study on Turkish Twitter

The 2023 Turkish elections are approaching, so the number of political content on Turkey's Twitter is increasing rapidly these days. Also, there are too many accounts that generate content in an automated way. The present project aims to address two issues in the context of Turkish Twitter: the proliferation of political content and the prevalence of bot accounts. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, the project seeks to classify political tweets and distinguish between genuine user accounts and bots. The project is being undertaken as part of the Machine Learning course offered by Dr. Onur Varol at SabancÄ± University, with the ultimate goal of contributing to a deeper understanding of these issues and their impact on online discourse in Turkey. You can access the dataset used by the project in the Data section, labeled data has been annotated by authorized users. Raw data are dataframes created with features extracted in the project.
